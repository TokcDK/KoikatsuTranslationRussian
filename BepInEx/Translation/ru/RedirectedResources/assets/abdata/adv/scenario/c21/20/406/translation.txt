「――で？　その後、どうなったの？」=So?　And then what happened?
「うん、それで……って、だんだん混んできたね、今何時だろ……わっ！　もうこんな時間っ？」=Yeah, and ... is getting more and more crowded, what time is it ...?　What time is it?
「うわ、本当だ。まだ一時間ぐらいしか喋ってないと思ってたよ」=Wow, it's true. I thought we'd only been talking for about an hour.
「私もー……えへへ、時間を忘れるぐらい話し込んじゃうとか、私たち仲良しだね」=I thought we'd only been talking for about an hour... Me too. We talk so much we lose track of time, we're so close.
「あはは、本当にね。話題も尽きないし、幼馴染みじゃないのが不思議なくらいだよ」=Haha, really. We have so much to talk about, it's a wonder we're not childhood friends.
「もしかしたら前世で幼馴染みだったのかも、なーんて」=Maybe we were childhood friends in a past life.
「もしそうでも俺は驚かないよ、フィーリングばっちりすぎだし……あ、今入ってきた人でちょうど満席だね。出ようか」=I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case, the feeling is too good to be true... Oh, it's full with the people who just walked in. Let's leave.
（喫茶店でずっと話してただけだったけど、充実した時間だったなぁ……）=(We just talked for a long time in the coffee shop, but it was a fulfilling time...)
