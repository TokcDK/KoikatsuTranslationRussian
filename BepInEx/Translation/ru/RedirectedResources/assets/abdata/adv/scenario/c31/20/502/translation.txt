「ハァ、ハァ……すまん、少し準備に手間取った……慣れない事は、やるものではないな」=Huh, huh... Sorry, it took me a while to get ready... Don't do anything you're not used to.
「予定の３分前だし大丈夫だよ。走ってきたの？　凄い汗だよ？」=It's okay, it's three minutes before we're supposed to be there. Did you go for a run?　You're sweating like crazy.
「あぁ、全力でな……ぅぅ、あまり見るな。最初から汗だくで現れる彼女なんて……我ながら情けない」=Yeah, as hard as I can... Oh, don't look so hard. Don't look too ... at her. She's pathetic, showing up all sweaty from the start.
「そんな事ないって。遅れないように頑張ってくれたんでしょ？　そういうの、素直に嬉しいよ」=No, it's not. You've got to do your best to keep up, right?　I'm glad to hear that.
