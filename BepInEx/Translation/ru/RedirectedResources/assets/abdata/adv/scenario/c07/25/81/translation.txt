「ん～いい風。やっぱランチは屋上に限るなあ」=It's a nice breeze. I've always wanted to have lunch on the roof.
「へ～、天気が良いと、結構人が出るんだな。知らなかったよ」=I didn't know there were so many people on the roof when the weather is nice. I didn't know that.
「ちょっと[P]、他の子より私を見ろよな～」=Hey, P, look at me instead of the other girls.
「ああ、ゴメンな。別に女の子を見てたわけじゃないんだ」=Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't looking at the girls.
「あ、いや。こっちこそゴメン……ほらほら、これ私が作ったんだぜ？」=Oh, no. I'm sorry, too... Look, look, I made this, okay?
