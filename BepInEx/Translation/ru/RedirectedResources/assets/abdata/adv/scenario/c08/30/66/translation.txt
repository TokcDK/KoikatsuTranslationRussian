「ん～……あの雲は足が速そうだから好き。あの雲は頭が良さそうだから好き」=Hmmm..... I like that cloud because it looks fast. I like that cloud because it looks fast, and I like that cloud because it looks smart.
「えっと、つまりどっちなんだい？」=Well, which is it?
「どっちも好きなんだよ」=I like both of them.
「なるほど。聞いといてなんだけど、違いが良く分からない！」=I see. I'm sorry, but I don't know the difference!
