「うーん、こういう難しいところはどうしても参考書が必要になるわね」=Oof. This is too hard. Looks like Ill have to use the reference book afterall.
「あはは、[H名]はすごいよ。参考書見たら理解出来るんだもん」=Ahaha, you're amazing, [H名]. To be able to understand the problem just by looking at the reference book.
「もう、キミだって理解出来るでしょ？　私のこと、持ち上げすぎよ？」=Jeez~, You can do it too, can't you? Aren't you just trying to flatter me?
「そういうわけじゃないよ。本当にすごいと思ってるんだ。だって問題もさらさら解けてたし……」=That's not the case, I really do think you're amazing. You're also going through the questions at a breakneck pace
「それを言ったらキミだって……結構簡単に解いてたじゃない。何ページも一気に……」=If you say that, then what about you? You're also going through page after page like nothing.
「え……もしかして[H名]、俺のこと見てたの？」=Eh, by any chance, were you looking at me?
「も、もうっ、先に言ったのはキミでしょう？　確かにっ……気になって見てたけど……指摘されると恥ずかしくなるじゃない。もー！」=Je-Jeez~, Weren't you the one who said it first? Yes, certainly, I was looking at you out of curiosity... But if you point it out that bluntly, I'll get embarrased you know! Jeez~
