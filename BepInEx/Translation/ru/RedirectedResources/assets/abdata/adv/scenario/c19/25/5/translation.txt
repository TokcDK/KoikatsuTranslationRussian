「う、うん。いいけど、何をするの？　……あ、本の整理とかかな？」=I can literally not stand up. Okay, but what are you doing?　... Oh, I don't know, maybe organize some books?
「えっ！？　きみらしいといえばらしいけど、それって運動に入るのかな？」=What?　That sounds like you, but does that count as exercise?
「あ……確かに。で、でも、意外と力のいる仕事だったりするんだよ？」=Oh... sure. And yet, it can be a surprisingly strenuous job.
