「それは構わないけど、どこで？　まさかここで？　くすくすっ」=I don't particularly mind, but where, exactly? Are you suggesting we do it here? *Giggle*
「え、いや、そもそもいいの？　俺たち付き合ってないけど……」=Eh, No, to begin with, are you really okay with it? We're not exactly dating...
「よくなかったら断ってるもの。それとも、とんだ尻軽女だと思った？」=If I wasn't, I would have refused you. Or is it that you think of me as a total slut?
「そんなこと思わないよ。[H名]さんのことはよく分かってるつもりだし」=I don't think of you that way. I'd like to think I know you well enough by now, [H名]-san
「ね、そういうあなただからいいと思ったの。他の男の子なんて眼中にないんだから、遠慮しないで好きにして」=You know, it's because you're like that, that I was okay with it. I don't care about any other boys, so don't be shy, do as you like.
