（料理が来るまで、何話そうかな。最近の話題はほとんど話しちゃったし……）=(What should we talk about until the food comes? (What should we talk about until the food arrives? I've already told you most of what I've been talking about lately...)
「お冷、おいしいね」=(What should we talk about until the food arrives?
「そう、なの？　じゃあ飲んでみる」=Oh, really?　I'll have a drink.
「んん、ごくん……ごめんなさい……水の、良し悪しが、わからない……」=Mmm, mmm... I'm sorry... I don't know if water is good or bad...
「……うん、まあ、俺も別に水の成分について話したいわけじゃないし……」=... Yeah, well, I don't really want to talk about the ingredients in the water either...
（どうしよう。何か盛り上がるきっかけは……あっ）=(What should I do? I don't really want to talk about the composition of water.
「そういえば今朝、動物喫茶の特集をテレビで見たんだ。動物好き？」=I saw a special about animal cafes on TV this morning. Do you like animals?
「……好き。犬、猫、鳥、どれも、いい。動物は……しゃべらなくても懐いてくれるから、楽」=I like ... Dogs, cats, birds, they're all good. Animals are easy because you don't have to ... talk to them and they like you.
「あはは、[H名]らしいね。動物好きの女の子って可愛いと思う。今度、動物喫茶行ってみようよ」=Haha, that's so [H名]. I think girls who like animals are cute. Let's go to an animal cafe next time.
「……うん。できるなら……触れ合うことができる。場所が、いい」=... Yes. If you can, go to ... where you can interact with them. I want a place where I can touch them.
「触れ合える場所か。だと猫カフェとか犬カフェあたりかな。わかった、探してみる」=A place where you can touch them. So, maybe a cat cafe or a dog cafe. Okay, I'll look for it.
「……どちらかと言えば、好きじゃない。特に……そういうのは……」=If anything, I don't like ... I don't like ... either, especially ... that kind of thing.
「そっか。好き嫌いは誰にだってあるし」=I see. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes.
「あの……だから……動物、喫茶みたいのがダメってだけで……ドキュメンタリーは好き」=It's just that ... I don't like ... animals, like coffee shops, but I do like ... documentaries.
「ペットも……苦手。動物は自然に、いてこそ、だって思う。飼うのって、人の……エゴ」=I don't like ... pets either. I think animals should be in nature. I think animals should be in their natural habitat. Owning animals is a form of ... ego.
「いろいろ考えてるんだね。俺なんて可愛いなぁぐらいとしか思ってなかったし」=You must have a lot on your mind. I only thought they were cute.
「……私……可愛くない？」=Isn't ... me ... cute?
「そんなことないさ。それってある意味で生物を真に愛してるってことだと思うしさ」=No, it's not. No, I don't think so. I think it means you really love the creature in a way.
「……ありがとう」="...Thank you."
