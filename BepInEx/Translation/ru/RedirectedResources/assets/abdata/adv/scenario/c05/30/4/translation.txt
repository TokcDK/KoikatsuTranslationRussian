「うん、いいよ。だれかと一緒に勉強するなんて、いつ以来かな」=No, it's okay. When was the last time you studied with someone?
「ひとりでするより、はかどると思うよ。ところで、それは何の本？」=I think you'll get more done than you would on your own. What's that book about, anyway?
「『宇宙からのメッセージを受容しうる身体を得る方法』だよ？」=It's called How to Make Your Body Receptive to Messages from the Universe.
「できれば今日は、別の勉強をしようか」=If it's all right with you, I'll give you something else to study today.
