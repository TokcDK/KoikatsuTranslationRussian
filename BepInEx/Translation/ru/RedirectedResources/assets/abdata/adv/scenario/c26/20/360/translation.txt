「……声、漏れて、ない？」=... Are you sure your voice isn't leaking?
「まぁ、気になるよね。でも、大丈夫だよ。横切る影はなかったと思うし」=Well, it's a concern. But I'm fine. I don't think there was a shadow crossing the room.
「空調が聞いてるとはいえ、少し体が火照ったよ。[H名]も温かったし」=The air conditioning is on, but my body is still a little on fire. [H名] was warm, too.
「いやらしい。……ねぇ、もう時間、だよ」=That's disgusting... Hey, it's time to go.
「もうか。いや、丁度良かったのかも。それじゃ、支度して出ようか」=Already? Well, maybe it was just as well. Well, let's get you ready and get out of here.
「私……トイレ行ってる」=I'm going to ... the bathroom.
「オッケー。俺は、受付でお金払っておくから。そこで待ってるよ」=Okay. I'll go to the reception and pay for it. I'll wait for you there.
