（待ち合わせの２０分前か。少し早く来過ぎたけど……ん？　あそこにいるの、[H名]だよね？）=(20 minutes before the meeting. I came a little too early... Hmm?　That's [H名] over there, right?
「やぁ、早いね[H名]。もういるなんて、少し驚いちゃったよ」=Hi, you're early. I'm a little surprised you're already here.
「んぇっ！？　お、おまえこそ早いな……な、何か先に片付けたい用事でもあったのか？」=Huh?　You're the one who's early... Did you have something you wanted to take care of first?
「いや、そういうわけじゃないけど。デートが楽しみで早く出てきちゃったんだ」=No, it's not like that. I was looking forward to our date so I came out early.
「そ、そうか……私も、だいたい同じだ。用事があるわけでないなら……もう行くか？」=I'm looking forward to our date, so I came out early. If you don't have anything to do, do you want to go to ...?
「そうだね。早く着いた分、長くデートを楽しもう！」=Yes, I do. The earlier we get there, the longer we can enjoy the date!
（よーし、まずはどこに行こうかな……）=(Alright, where should we go first ...?
