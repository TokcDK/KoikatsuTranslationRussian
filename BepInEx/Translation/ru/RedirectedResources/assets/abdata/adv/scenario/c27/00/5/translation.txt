「そういえば男子ってよく校庭でドッジボールしてたわよね。あんたもそういうの好きなんだ」=I remember when boys used to play dodgeball in the schoolyard. You like that kind of thing too?
「さすがにガキの頃みたくはしゃいだりはしないけど……体動かすのは今でも好きだよ」=I don't get as excited as I did when I was a kid, but I still like to ... exercise.
「ふぅん……いいわ、付き合ってあげる。昔、男子たち見てて、気になってはいたのよね」=I don't get as excited as I did when I was a kid, but I still like to exercise. I used to watch the boys and I was always curious about them.
