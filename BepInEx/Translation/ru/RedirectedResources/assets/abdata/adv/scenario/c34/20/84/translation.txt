「アノー……ＫＯＩ－ＫＡＴＳＵ部ハ、エッチする部活？」=No...
「いやいやいや、コイカツ部自体はとてもクリーンで健全な部活だよ……多分」=No, no, no. The Koi-Katsu club is a very clean and healthy club... Maybe.
「Ｉ　ｓｅｅ♪　ニッポン語の『アイ』と『コイ』、英語に直すとドッチも『Ｌｏｖｅ』ダカラ、言葉のｎｕａｎｃｅ難しいネー」=I see. The Japanese words "I" and "Koi" are both "Love" in English, so it's hard to nuance the words.
「そうなんだ……あれ？　Ｌｏｖｅとｌｉｋｅは違うんだよね？」=I see... Huh?　Love and like are different, aren't they?
「違うケド、『アイ』と『コイ』と言うヨリ、『大』と『小』ミタイ。『アイ』と『コイ』ニモ『大』と『小』あるデショ？」=No, but it's more like 'big' and 'small' than 'I' and 'Koy'. No, but it's more like "big" and "small" than "I" and "koi." "I" and "koi" also have "big" and "small.
（なるほど、わかったような、わからないような……というか、すごく学問的にコイカツしてる気がする）=(I get it, I get it, I don't get it... but I feel like I'm being very academically coy.
