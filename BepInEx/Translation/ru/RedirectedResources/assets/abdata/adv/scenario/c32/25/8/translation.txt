「婚姻関係はおろか、恋人でさえないというのに、あなたと私で性交渉を？」=We're not even married, let alone lovers, and you and I are having sexual intercourse?
「言いたいことはわかるよ。でも、どうしても君としたいんだ」=I know what you mean. I know what you mean, but I really want to do it with you.
「……そう真っ直ぐ言われると、断れないじゃないですか、もう……」=I know what you mean, but I really want to do it with you... When you say it like that, it's hard to say no...
