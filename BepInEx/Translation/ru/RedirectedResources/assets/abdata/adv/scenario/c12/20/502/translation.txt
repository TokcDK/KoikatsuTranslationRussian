「あ、[H名]いた。……って、隣のお婆さんは誰だ？　何か話し込んでるみたいだけど……」=Oh, there's [H名]. Who's that old lady next to you at ...?　She seems to be talking about something...
「あ、お婆さん行っちゃった……おーい！　[H名]、こっちこっち」=Oh, the old lady's gone... Hey!　[H名], over here, over here.
「あぁ、もういたのか。もしかして今の見てたか？　ちょっと道案内を頼まれちゃってな」=Oh, you're already here. Did you see what just happened?　I was asked to show you the way.
「そうだったんだ。親切したから何か良い事あるかもね。それじゃ、行こうか？」=Oh, right. I did you a favor, so maybe something good will come of it. Let's go, shall we?
