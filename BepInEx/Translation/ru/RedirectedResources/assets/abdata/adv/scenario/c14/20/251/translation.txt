（……ふぅ、もうすぐ駅か。今日のデートも二人でいっぱい遊んだな）=I've been thinking the same thing... Hmm, almost to the station. We had a lot of fun together on our date today.
（特に最後の観覧車……二人きりになれて、いい雰囲気だったよなぁ）=I don't know what you mean. - Especially the last one, the Ferris wheel... It was nice to be alone with someone.
（……うん、この次も絶対[H名]を楽しませるデートにしよう！）=(...Yeah, I'll definitely make the next date fun for [H名]!
