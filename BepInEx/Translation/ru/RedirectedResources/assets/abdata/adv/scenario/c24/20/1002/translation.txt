「……まずは俺から入場するんだったな」=... I'm supposed to go first, right?
（[H名]、すごく楽しみにしてたからな……格好いいところ見せないと）=I was really looking forward to it... I have to show you something cool.
（まるで本物の新郎新婦みたいに……覚悟を決めるか）=(Are you going to prepare yourself ... like a real bride and groom?
（いよいよ出番か……）=(Finally, it's time to go ...)
（すごい豪華だな……）=(It's gorgeous...)
（うん……幸せ絶頂の[H名]を迎え入れよう）=Yeah, let's welcome ... [H名] at the height of his happiness.
（ふぅ……ちょっと緊張したけど、[H名]の新郎役として堂々とできたかな）=I was a little ... nervous, but I think I did a great job as [H名]'s groom.
「これより新婦が入場致します。後方の扉口をご覧ください」=The bride will now enter. Please look at the rear doorway.
（……[H名]？）=(...[H名]?)
[H名]は怯えた小動物のように震えていて、俺だけでなくスタッフの人たちの息を呑ませた。=[H名] was trembling like a frightened little animal, and it took the breath away not only from me, but from the staff as well.
純白のドレスはとても似合ってるはずなのに、縮こまってしまっているからか、ドレスに着られてしまっているようだ。=The pure white dress should have looked so good on her, but she seemed to have shrunk down, or maybe the dress was wearing her down.
すぐに駆けつけようとしたが、おずおずと歩き出そうとした[H名]を見えて踏みとどまる。=I was going to run to her immediately, but I stopped when I saw [H名] who was about to walk out unsteadily.
（な、何があったんだ？）=(Hey, what's going on?)
「[H名]……？」=[H名]...?
「あ……ぅ……」=Oh.....
