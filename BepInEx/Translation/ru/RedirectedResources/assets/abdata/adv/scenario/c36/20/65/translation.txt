「貴方と並んで帰るなんて、不思議な気分ね。ほら、何か面白い話の一つでもしなさい」="It's a strange feeling, walking home alongside you. C'mon, say something interesting."
「えっ！？　えっとぉ……いつもは誰と帰ってるの？」="Huh? U-um... Is there someone you usually go home with?"
「特にいないわよ。誰かと一緒に帰る事自体が珍しいわね。で？　これが面白い話なの？」="No, not really. Going home with anyone is rather rare for me. So? Is that something interesting?"
