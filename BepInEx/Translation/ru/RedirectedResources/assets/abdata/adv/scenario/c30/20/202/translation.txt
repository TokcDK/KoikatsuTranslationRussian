「あの着ぐるみ、さっきからウロウロしてるけど、いまいち人気がないみたいだね」=That mascot, it's been wandering around for a while now, but it doesn't look like it's very popular.
「そうね、ちょっと可哀相。普通マスコットキャラって、もっと子供が囲んでいたりしないかしら？」=Looks like it, it's a bit sad. Don't most mascot characters normally have tons of kids surrounding them?
「普通そうだと思う。うーん、だからと言って俺達が絡みにいくのもなぁ……」=Normally, I'd think so too. Um, even if you say that, I don't think we should get involved...
「いいじゃない。ふふ、面白そうだし、ちょっと行ってみましょうよ」=Isn't it fine? Fufu, seems interesting, let's go take a quick look.
「えっ、ちょ、待って[H名]！　あぁ……行っちゃったか、仕方ない……」=Eh, wait a minute, [H名]! Aahh... She already left, well, it can't be helped...
………………=...
「キミ、そうそこの着ぐるみのキミ、一人で寂しそうね？　あんまり人気、ないのかな？」=Hey, you, the one in the costume, aren't you feeling lonely all by yourself? I guess you're not very popular?
「うわ、聞き方がストレート過ぎだよ……もう少しオブラートに包んで……」=Uwaah, you're being way too blunt... At least sugarcoat it a bit...
「あら、ごめんなさい。ん？　風船をくれるの？　私に？　ふふ、ありがとう」=Oh, I'm sorry about about that. Hm? A balloon? For me? Fufu, thank you.
「あー、なんか一瞬で打ち解けてるね……俺、ベンチで待ってようかな……」=Ah, you sure are getting along super well even though you just met... Maybe I'll go wait at the bench...
「えっ、ちょっと待って。もう、着ぐるみにヤキモチ？　ほら、キミにも風船くれるって、もらってあげて？」=Eh, wait a minute. Geez, are you seriously jealous of a mascot? Look, they're giving you a balloon, why don't you take it?
「うーん、ど、どうも……わーい、風船もらっっちゃったー……なんて、はは……」=Yeah, t-thanks... Yaaay, I got a balloon... Just kidding, haha...
「ぁはは……もうちょっと自然に喜んであげないと……え？　ちょっと、どうして押して――」=Ahaha... You'll have to act more naturally that you're happy or else... eh? What is it? Wait, why are you push--
「キャッ……！」=Kya...!
「わっ、[H名]っ！　あぶないっ！　っとと……大丈夫？」=Woah, [H名]! That's dangerous! Here you go... Are you okay?
「ありがとう。ふぅ……あら？　着ぐるみさん、行っちゃったわね……お姉さん、怒らせちゃったかしら……」=Thank you. Fuu... Oh? It looks like mascot-san disappeared... I wonder if they got angry because of this onee-san...
「いや、たぶん気を使ってくれたんじゃないかな……俺がヤキモチ焼いてたから、[H名]を返してくれたんだと思う」=No, I'm sure that they were trying to be mindful of us... Since I was being jealous and all, I think they gave you back to me, [H名]...
「そっか、優しい人だったのね……きっとすぐに、人気が出るわ」=I see, what a kind person... I'm sure they'll become popular in no time.
「そうだといいね。あ、風船に何か紙が付いてるみたいだよ？　チラシか何かかな？」=That'd be nice if that were to be the case. Ah, looks like there's something stuck to the balloon. Is this a flyer or something?
「ん？　あぁ、スタンプラリーって書いてあるわね……ふふっ、折角だから、やってみる？」=Hm? Ahh, it's a flyer for a stamp rally... Fufu, since we're here, wanna try it?
「そうだね。[H名]が好きな、着ぐるみがくれたものだし」=You're right. Since [H名]'s favourite mascot gave it to us.
「んぅ～、まだヤキモチ焼いてるの？　嬉しいような、申し訳ないような、複雑な気分ね……」=Hmmmm, are you still jealous? I feel happy yet guilty at the same time, it's a complicated feeling...
「はは、ちょっとからかっただけだよ。でも、物怖じせず話かけたのは、流石[H名]だなって思ったよ」=Haha, I was just teasing you. But, just going up and talking to them without feeling bashful, that sure is like you, [H名].
「そうなの？　私は普通に話しかけただけよ？　ちょっと馴れ馴れし過ぎたかしら？」=You think so? I was just talking to them normally though? Was I being too overfamiliar?
「いや、そういうわけじゃなくて。[H名]のコミュニケーション能力の高さに驚いただけ」=No, that's not what I mean. I was just surprised by the level of your communication skills, [H名].
「きっと、あの人も嬉しかったんじゃないかな？　スタンプラリーが終わったら、また会いに行ってもいいかもね」=I'm sure that person was also happy that someone came to talk to them. After the stamp rally, I think it would be nice to go meet them again.
