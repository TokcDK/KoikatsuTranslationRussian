「屋上に来ると青春じゃと思うのは、わしだけなのかのう？」=Is it just me, or does coming to the rooftop make you feel like you're coming of age?
「他じゃ屋上に行けないところもあるらしいね」=I hear you can't go to the roof in some places.
「屋上に恋人が２人っきりって、けっこういい雰囲気になるよね」=I've heard that some places don't allow you to go on the roof. - It's quite a nice atmosphere when two lovers are alone on the roof.
「……な、何を突然。……でも、話してるだけでもいいムードじゃな……」=... What are you doing all of a sudden? ... But just talking about it is a good mood...
「……のう、急に黙ったままは緊張するのじゃ。ほかに誰もいないし……」=... I'm nervous about being quiet all of a sudden. There's no one else here...
「……確かに緊張するね。こういう気持ちを知るのもコイカツなのかな」=... It's definitely nerve-racking. I'm sure you're nervous. I wonder if it's part of being a Koikatsu to know these feelings.
