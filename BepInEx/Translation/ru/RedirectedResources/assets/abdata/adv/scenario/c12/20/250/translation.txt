「あぁ、さらば遊園地……また会おう……」=Ah, goodbye amusement park ... see you soon ...
「おいおい、感傷に浸り過ぎだろ……そんなに楽しかったのか？　遊園地」=Oh, come on, you're getting too sentimental... Was it that much fun?　The amusement park.
「もちろん、普通に遊ぶだけで楽しいのに、[H名]と一緒だったんだよ。もう楽園はここにありって感じだったね」=Of course it was fun just to play, but I was with [H名]. It was like paradise was right here.
「そこまでは大袈裟過ぎるけど、あたしも楽しかったよ、おまえと一緒に遊園地で遊べてさ」=That's a bit of an exaggeration, but I had a lot of fun, too, playing at the amusement park with you.
「また来ようね。二人で一緒に」=Let's come back again. We'll come back again, just the two of us.
