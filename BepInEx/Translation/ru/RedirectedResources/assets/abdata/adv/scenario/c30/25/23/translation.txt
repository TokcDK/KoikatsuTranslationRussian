「あの……これ、私が作ったお菓子……なんだけど……あ、作ったと言っても家庭科の授業でよ？　でも……良かったら食べてみてくれない……かしら？」=Uhm... Here, I made these sweets... Well, I say I made them but it was during home-ec class so... But, anyway, won't you try them...?
「いいの！？　おお、すごい、売り物みたいに綺麗だよ！」=Is it really okay!? Ooh! Amazing! These look as pretty as the ones they sell in stores!
「ふふっ、キミにあげる分だけは……特に丁寧に作ったの。だって……幻滅されたくないんですもの。喜んでもらえたら嬉しいわ」=Fufuu~, I worked extra carefully on your portion... After all, I didn't want you to get disillusioned. Seeing you be so happy with them makes me very happy too...
