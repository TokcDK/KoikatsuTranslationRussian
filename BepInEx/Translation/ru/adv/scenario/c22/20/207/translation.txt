「夜景も堪能したし、今日はそろそろ帰ろうか」=Now that we've enjoyed the night view, let's go home.
「そうだね。えへへ、観覧車の中でのこと……思い出すとちょっと恥ずかしい……」=Yeah, I guess so. I'm a little embarrassed to remember ... what we did on the Ferris wheel.
「分かる……二人きりだから言えたこと……だもんね」=I know ... what you said because it was just the two of us.
「うん……何だか夢みたいな時間だったよ……観覧車って素敵だね」=Yeah... it was kind of a dreamy time... Ferris wheels are wonderful.
「あのまま何周でも回れたら良かったのに……なんて、さすがに今日はもう限界だよね」=It would have been nice if we could have gone around ... as many times as we wanted, but I think we've reached our limit today.
「うん……でも、また二人で来れるよ。絶対に」=Yes... but we can come back together again. I promise.
