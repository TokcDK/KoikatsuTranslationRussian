「上手に出来たわね。痴漢の才能、あるんじゃない？」=You sure did it well. Looks like you have quite the talent as a molester.
「場所的に素直に頷けないよ」=I honestly can't accept that as a compliment, not in a place like this.
「ふふっ、もし知らない子に痴漢したくなってもしちゃだめよ。私で我慢しなさいね」=Fufu--, You mustn't grope a stranger regardless even if you get the urge. Make do with me, alright?
