「あぁ、校内で噂になってる部活のことね。このわたしに入って欲しいの？」=Oh, you're talking about the club that's been going around the school. Do you want me to join?
「うん、きみと一緒に部活やりたくて……イヤなら別に構わないけど」=Yes, I want to be in the club with you... If you don't want to, that's fine.
「だ、誰が『イヤ』なんて言ったのよ！　入るに決まってるでしょ！」=I don't care if you don't like it. - Who said anything about not liking it?　Of course I'm in!
「ほんとに！？　ありがとう！」=Really?　Thank you!
「でも、コイカツ部って何をやる部活なの？」=But what does the Koyukatsu Club do?
「女子を男子との付き合いに慣れさせる部活みたいだよ」=It's a club that helps girls get used to being with boys.
「へえ、なんか面白そう！　なんだか、考えるだけでワクワクするわ」=Wow, that sounds interesting!　I'm getting excited just thinking about it.
