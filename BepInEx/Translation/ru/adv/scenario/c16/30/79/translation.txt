「ここの日替わりランチ、美味しいのよね。お気に入りなの」=You know, they have a really good daily lunch. It's my favorite.
「そうなんだ。じゃあ今日は俺もそれにしようかな」=I see. Well, I think I'll have that today.
「日替わりだから、一週間来ないと全部制覇できないわよ。ふふっ、また来る理由が出来たわね」=It changes every day, so you'll have to come back for a week to get them all. Now I have a reason to come back.
