「うぅ～～んっ！　凄く解放的ね。ここで食べたら何でも美味しそう」=Mmmmmm!　It's so liberating. Everything looks so good when you eat here.
「ホントだね。今日は購買だったけど、お弁当とか作ってきたら最高だろうね」=That's true. I had to buy something today, but it would be great if I brought my own lunch or something.
「あら？　それはリクエスト？　仕方ないわね。今度気が向いたら作って来てあげる」=Oh?　Is that a request?　I can't help it. I'll make it for you next time I feel like it.
「えっ！　ほ、ホントに！　楽しみだなぁ……」=What?　Really!　I'm looking forward to it...
