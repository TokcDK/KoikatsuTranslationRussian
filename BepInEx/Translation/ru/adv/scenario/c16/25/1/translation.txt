「[H姓]さん、今大丈夫？　その、出来れば話したいなって」=[Last name], are you okay now?　I was wondering if I could talk to you.
「ふぅん、噂通りね。そうして色々な女の子に声をかけて回っているわけ？」=Hmmm, just as they say. So that's how you've been going around talking to different girls?
「あー、まぁそうなんだけど。ごめん、気分悪くさせちゃってたかな？」=Oh, yeah, that's right. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel bad.
「何故謝るの？　私は事実を言っただけ。そこに特別な感情を込めたつもりはないわ」=Why are you apologizing?　I was just stating a fact. I was just stating a fact. I didn't mean to put any special feelings into it.
「そっか、ごめん。俺の勘違い。じゃあその、話を続けてもいいかな？」=I see. I'm sorry. My mistake. Well, can we keep talking?
