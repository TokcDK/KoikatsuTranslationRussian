「ここの夜景は何度も見ても綺麗ね。キミが隣にいるっていうのが、また最高っ！」=No matter how many times I see this night sky, it's still just as pretty as that day. I love being here with you!
「一人で見てたら、ここまで感動はしないのかもね」=If you went see this scenery alone, it probably wouldn't feel as moving.
「ええ、そうだと思うわ。好きな人と一緒に見る景色だから、何度見ても飽きないのよ、きっと……」=Yep, I think so too. This is the kind of scenery you have to enjoy with someone you love, I don't think it's a sight you could get bored of otherwise...
「ここはもう、すっかり二人のお気に入りスポットだね」=This place has already become one of our favourite spots, huh.
「こういう場所を、どんどん増やしていきたいわ……キミとの思い出、もっとたくさん作りたい」=I want to share even more spots like this with you... I want to create even more memories with you.
「うん、俺も。[H名]との思い出、いっぱい作りたい」=Yeah, same here. I want to make lots of memories with you, [H名].
「ふふ、キミが作りたいとか言うと……子作りを連想しちゃうわね……」=Fufu, when you say something like that... I can't help but feel like you're talking about making babies instead...
「えぇっ、俺ってそんな風に見られてたの？」=Ehhh, do you really think of me like that?
「だって、こんなに綺麗な夜景を見た後に、する事しちゃったじゃない……流石に忘れられないわ」=It's because just after we had looked at this scenery together for the first time, we did that thing... There's no way I could forget it.
「あっ、もしかして……キミがここをお気入りな理由って、私とそういう事をしやすいからなの？」=Ah, maybe... the reason why this is your favorite spot, is because I become easy for you?
「いや、それは……えぇっと……」=No, that's... Um...
「全部じゃないけど……そういう理由も、少しはあるかも……」=That's not the whole reason but... that might be a small part of it...
「ふふ、キミの言う少しはどれくらいなの？　半々くらい？」=Fufu, how much exactly do you mean by a small part? Is it about half?
「えっと……それよりちょっと……エッチ寄りかな……」=Er... Maybe just a little... more on the lewd side...
「もう、伏せて言ってたのに……本当にキミは、欲望に正直なんだから……」=Geez, even thought I told you to be less blunt... You really are honest to a fault about your lust...
「ごめん……少しはムードも考えろって感じだよね？」=Sorry... I should think about the mood more, shouldn't I?
「うーん、わかっているなら実践してくれると嬉しいんだけど……まだキミには難しいのかしら？」=Well, if you understand, then I'd like to see you actually try... I wonder if it's still too hard for you?
「うっ……そうだね。ちょっとその……[H名]が可愛すぎるからいけないんだよ？」=Ugh... you're right. It's just that... You're so cute, [H名], that I can't help it, you know?
「えぇっ、そこで私のせいになっちゃうの？　そっかぁ、お姉さんのせいかぁ……」=Eehh, you're making it my fault now? I see, so it's onee-san's fault, huh...
「……なら、責任取らなくっちゃね」=...Then, I guess I'll have to take responsibility.
「えっ、あっ、いや……そこまで本気で言ったわけじゃなくて……」=Eh, ah, no... I didn't mean for that to be taken so seriously...
「なぁに？　お姉さんは可愛くないの？　お世辞だったんだ……しゅーん」=What? So you're saying that onee-san isn't cute? So it was just flattery... Hmph.
「しゅーん、て……うぅ、可愛いよ！　そういう仕草とか、ズルいくらい可愛い！」=Don't pout... Uh, you really are cute! Even that acting of your's, it's so cute that it's unfair!
「ふふ、キミがそうやって顔真っ赤にしちゃうのも可愛いよ。じゃあ、お互いに可愛い顔の見せっこ、しちゃおうか？」=Fufu, saying that with a flushed face like that is also really cute. Then, should we both enjoy each other's cute faces?
「うん、そうだね。あんまりここで騒いでると目立っちゃうし……そろそろ移動しよう」=Yeah, let's do that. If we make too much of a racket here, we'll stand out... We should move to a different place.
「そんなんじゃないって……俺って、[H名]の体しか見てないと思われてるの？」=That's not it... Do you really think that I think of nothing but your body all day, [H名]?
「あっ……ごめんね。私、ちょっと調子に乗っちゃったみたい……どうしたら機嫌、直してくれるかな？」=Ah... Sorry. I got a bit carried away... What can I do to fix the mood?
「大丈夫、怒ってるわけじゃないよ。ただ、体目当てとか思われてたら、悲しいなって……」=It's fine, it's not like I'm angry or anything. It's just, if you think that I only like you for your body, I'd be really sad...
「そう、だよね……お姉さん、ちょっとデリカシーなさ過ぎたかも……本当にごめんね……」=You're right... Onee-san was lacking in some delicacy there... I'm really sorry...
（あれ……まずいな……こんな重い空気にしたいわけじゃなかったんだけど……）=(Oh... This is bad... I didn't mean to make the atmosphere so heavy...)
「あっ！　流れ星！」=Ah! A shooting star!
「えっ、どこ？　……って、嘘ね？　ふふ、そういう気の使い方もできるようになってるのね、キミは」=Eh, where? ...Hey, was that a lie? Fufu, you've already become used to being able to change the mood like that, huh.
「はは……ちょっと強引かなと思ったけど、[H名]と暗い雰囲気のまま別れるのは嫌だなって……」=Haha... I thought it was a little forced, but I didn't want to part ways with [H名] when there's such a gloomy atmosphere between us...
「えっ……別れるって……ぇと、今日はって事よね？　まさか……」=Eh... By part ways, do you mean... Er, you mean just for today, right? There's no way that...
「わぁっ、違う違う！　もう暗いし、送っていくって意味だって！　はぁ……本当に、そういう意味じゃないからね！」=Woah, no, it's not like that! It's already dark out, I just meant to drop you off back home! Hah... Seriously, I didn't mean it that way!
CHOICE:『そうかも……です』=You might be... right.
CHOICE:『違うよ、そうじゃないって』=You're right, I didn't mean it like that!
