「ふぅ、これで本当に遊園地とはさよならかしら」=Fuu, I suppose this really is farewell to the amusement park.
「そうだね……なんか一気に寂しくなっちゃったな……」=You're right... Somehow, it feels really lonely all of a sudden.
「なら、また来ればいいじゃない。私なら、何回だって付き合ってあげるわよ」=In that case, we should come again sometime. I'll tag along with you as many times as you want.
「[H名]……ありがとう。それじゃあ、名残惜しいけど、今日は帰ろうか」=[H名]... Thank you. Then, although it's regrettable, let's go home for today.
