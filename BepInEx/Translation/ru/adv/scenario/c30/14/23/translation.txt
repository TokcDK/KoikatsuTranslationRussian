「あの……これ、私が作ったお菓子……なんだけど……あ、作ったと言っても家庭科の授業でよ？　でも……良かったら食べてみてくれない……かしら？」=Um... Here, I made these sweets... But... Ah, I say I made them but it was during home-ec class, you know? But... if you don't mind, would you... try them?
「いいの！？　おお、すごい、売り物みたいに綺麗だよ！」=Is that okay!? Ooh, amazing, these look as pretty as the ones they sell in stores!
「ふふっ、キミにあげる分だけは……特に丁寧に作ったの。だって……幻滅されたくないんですもの。喜んでもらえたら嬉しいわ」=Fufu, I worked extra carefully on your portion. After all... I didn't want you to be disappointed. Seeing you happy would make me happy too.
