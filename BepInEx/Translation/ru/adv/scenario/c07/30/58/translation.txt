「ほら、見てみろよ。あっちにもカップルがいるぞ。あっ……腕、組んでる……いいなぁ」=Hey, check it out. Look, there's another couple over there. Look, there's another couple over there... They're linking arms... I like that.
「ほら、見てないで俺たちも行こう。……腕、組むか？」=Don't just look at them, let's go with them. Do you want to ... put your arm around me?
「……手なら、いいぞ」=I'll take your ... hand.
「さっきから大人しいけど、具合でもわるい？」=You've been quiet for a while. What's wrong with you?
「ち、ちがう！　お前って、見かけより手が硬い。やっぱ男子だよなあ……って」=No, no, no!　Your hands are harder than they look. You're a boy...
