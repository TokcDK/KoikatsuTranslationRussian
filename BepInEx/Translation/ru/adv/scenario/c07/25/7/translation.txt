「そ、それってつまり……、こっ、恋人というか、その……あれか？」=So, is that ... or is that your girlfriend, or is that ...?
「うん。その“あれ”だよ。俺と付き合ってほしいんだ」=Yeah. Yeah, that's it. I want you to go out with me.
「……お、お前は私でいいのか……？　私ってほら、この通り女っぽくないし……」=I want you to go out with me... Oh, are you sure you want to be me...?　I'm not very feminine, as you can see...
「……嫌なのか？　真剣に答えてくれ」=You don't like ...?　Give me a serious answer.
「バカやろ！　い、嫌なわけなくてその……こちらこそ、よろしく……な……」=You're an idiot!　No, of course not... Nice to meet you, too...
