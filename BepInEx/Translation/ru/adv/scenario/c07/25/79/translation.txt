「さっ、メシメシ～。今日はなに食べる？」=What's for dinner? What are you having today?
「ここって結構、色々あるんだよな。迷うね」=There's a lot to choose from here, isn't there? I can't decide.
「おー、迷ったら肉じゃないか？　男子と言えば肉、筋肉と言えば男子。だろ？」=Oh, when in doubt, go for meat.　When you think of men, you think of meat, and when you think of muscles, you think of men. Right?
