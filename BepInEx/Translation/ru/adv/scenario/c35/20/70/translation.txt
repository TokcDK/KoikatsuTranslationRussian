「ふふっ、ねぇねぇ、図書室でお勉強ってなんかわくわくせん？」=Hey, hey, isn't it exciting to study in the library?
「……？　どういう風に？」=...?　What do you mean?
「ほら、こんなに静かなとこやん？　そこで二人で……なんて……青春っぽいやん」=See, it's such a quiet place, isn't it?　You know, it's such a quiet place, and it's ... youthful for the two of us.
「あはは、[H名]って本当に青春好きだよね。でも……まぁ、分かるかも。大人になったら、こんな風に勉強することもなくなりそうだし……」=Haha, [H名] really likes youth, doesn't he? But ... well, I guess I understand. When I grow up, I won't have to study like this anymore...
「うん。特に図書室で二人……なんてことはないっちゃないかなぁ。そう思うとね、今の時間ってすごく貴重やなぁって思うんよ」=I'm sure you're right. I'm sure there's nothing like ... two people in a library. When I think about it, I feel that the time we have now is very precious.
「なるほど、そっか……そうだよね。俺、毎日何気なく過ごしちゃってたかも。そう考えると、こういう勉強の時間も大切だよね」=I see... You're right. I think I've been spending my days without thinking about it. When I think about it, this kind of study time is also important.
「うんうん、めっちゃ貴重なんよ。やから……まだまだ一緒に頑張ろ？　楽しい思い出、いっぱい作りたいっちゃもん」=Yes, yes, it's very valuable. Yeah, it's really precious... Let's still work hard together.　I want to make lots of happy memories.
