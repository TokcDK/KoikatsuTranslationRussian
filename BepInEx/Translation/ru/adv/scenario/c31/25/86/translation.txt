「なぁ、私達はわざわざ部室に来なくても……常時コイカツ中という事にはならないのか？」=I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who's had this problem.
「そうだけど……ほら、雰囲気は大事でしょ？」=Yes, but ... the atmosphere is important, isn't it?
「それに、学園で二人きりになれる機会とかあんまりないし……上手く活用していこうよ」=And there aren't many opportunities for the two of you to be alone at school, so let's make ... the most of it.
「上手く活用……か。おまえが言うとやはりいやらしく聞こえるな」=I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you. You're making it sound awkward.
「俺の事なんだと思ってるの……彼氏なんだから、少しは信用してよ」=What do you think I am? ... You're my boyfriend, have a little faith in me.
「フフッ。なら、体に触れずに何かやりたい事はあるか？　今日はそれをやってみようじゃないか」=I'm your boyfriend. So what would you like to do without touching your body?　Why don't we try that today?
「ぐっ、そう言われると中々思いつかないけど……あっ、お互いの体を見せ合うとか？」=Gosh, I can't think of anything I'd like to do without touching each other... Oh, like showing each other our bodies?
「はぁ……結局その方向か。まぁいい、たしかにゆっくり見せ合うなんて機会は、あまりないからな」=I don't know... That's the direction you're going after all. Well, it's true that we don't have many opportunities to show each other our bodies.
「そう、正にそれ！　お触り禁止で、お互いの見たいところを交互に言っていく感じにしようか」=Yes, that's exactly it!　No touching, and we can take turns saying what we want to see.
