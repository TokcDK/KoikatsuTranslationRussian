「よかったけど……でも、急にどうしちゃったの？」=That's good, but ... what's going on?
「キミが私で反応してたのが嬉しくて……♡　遊園地でキミと遊ぶのが楽しかったから、胸がずっとキュンキュンしてて耐えられなくなったのかも♡」=I was happy to see you reacting to me...♡ I had so much fun playing with you at the amusement park that my heart was pounding all the time and I couldn't take it anymore.
（エロ[H名]だなぁ……でも、そういうところも好きなんだけどね）=(That's an erotic [H名]... But I like that part too.)
