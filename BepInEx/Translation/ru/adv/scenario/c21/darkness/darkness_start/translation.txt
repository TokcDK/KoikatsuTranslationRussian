「この部屋、ずーっと閉まってるから、いろんな噂が流れてるんだよね～。キミも聞いたことない？」=This room's been closed for a long time, so there are a lot of rumors going around. You've never heard of it?
「だからすっごくワクワクしてたんだけど……どう見てもただの物置だよね。ちょっとガッカリ」=That's why I was so excited, but ... it's just a storage room no matter how you look at it. I'm a little disappointed.
「あ、でも面白いものがあるかも！　ねぇ、探して……ん？　どうしたの？　なんか目、怖いよ？」=Oh, but there might be something interesting in there!　Hey, look for me at ...?　What's wrong?　What's wrong with your eyes?
「キャッ……！　だ、誰！？」=Oh, my God...!　Who's that?
