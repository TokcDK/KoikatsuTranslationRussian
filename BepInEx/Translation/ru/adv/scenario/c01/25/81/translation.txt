「ふふっ。部室でご飯を食べるって、学生ならではですよね」=Hmmm. Eating in the club room is something only a student can do, isn't it?
「確かに。しかも二人きりだからこんなこともできるよ――あーん」=That's true. And since it's just the two of us, we can do things like this.
「あっ……いただきますね。あーん」=Oh... I'll take it. Ahh.
「あむっ……んっ……いつもより１０割増しで美味しいです」=It's even more delicious than usual.
